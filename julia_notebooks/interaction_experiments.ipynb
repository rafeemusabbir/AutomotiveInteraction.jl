    "## Notebook to work with interaction dataset merge scenario `DR_CHN_Merging_ZS`\n",
    "    - Roadway generation\n",
    "    - Trajdata creation based on reading vehicle tracks from provided csv files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Changelog\n",
    "- Friday, Jan 31\n",
    "    - Creation\n",
    "    - Toy track generation using way if 10025 from `DR_CHN_Merging_ZS.osm`\n",
    "- Monday, Feb 3\n",
    "    - Begin trajdata creation to read in the vehicle tracks. Creation of struct called `INTERACTIONTrajdata`\n",
    "- Tuesday, Feb 4\n",
    "    - `Trajdata` reading nominally works. And rendered a scene of course without roadway. Some caveats\n",
    "        - `car_df_index` line 21 onwards check is commented out\n",
    "        - No `roadway` involved in the creation of `RecordState`\n",
    "    - Made a video of replaying the trajdata, of course without roadway, just cars in the blackness\n",
    "- Wednesday, Feb 5\n",
    "    - roadway building using `generate_merging_roadway` from `AutonomousMerging.jl`\n",
    "    - brought in `curevept_overlay` to do overlay the curve points that constitute a road\n",
    "    - Drove a car in the merging scenario to check that lane semantics works i.e. vehicle understands\n",
    "    how to keep lane\n",
    "    - second roadway inspired by William Brannon curved merging lane\n",
    "- Friday, Feb 7\n",
    "    - Started pipeline to read Soyeon's centerline data files\n",
    "    - Generated video replaying interaction dataset on roadways\n",
    "- Monday, Feb 10\n",
    "    - Cleanup to prepare for commit to `sisl/AutomotiveInteraction`\n",
    "- Wednesday, Feb 12\n",
    "    - Found that the vehicle state needs to have roadway information. Otherwise `observe!` in MOBIL cries\n",
    "    - This means that we can't initialize the vehicle state the way we have done so far i.e. \n",
    "    without providing a `roadway` argument\n",
    "    - Need to understand `lanes` and `lanetags` and modify roadway creation in terms of how tracks read from\n",
    "    centerlines txt files into the roadway object\n",
    "- Friday, Feb 14\n",
    "    - Got `proj` to work by making `roadway_interaction` in such a way that there are 7 segments, and each segment has only 1 lane. Thus during lane creation, the associated lanetag has `LaneTag(segment_id,1)` as opposed to earlier when the second argument of the LaneTag was going from 1 to 7\n",
    "- Monday, Feb 17\n",
    "    - Reorder notebook: make roadway before loading track information\n",
    "    - function to create the roadway from centerlines called `make_roadway_interaction()` moved to\n",
    "    `../src/roadway_building.jl`\n",
    "    - function to read in the vehicle tracks called `read_veh_tracks()` moved to\n",
    "    `../src/veh_track_reading.jl`\n",
    "    - Overlayed the vehicle id numbers on the rendered scene using `IDOverlay()`\n",
    "    - Driven vehicle id 29 using 2D Driver model. Gets stuck at the merge point because lane has\n",
    "    ended there. Need to fix this\n",
    "    - Made a new file within `src` called `driving_simulation.jl` to provide simulation functions.\n",
    "    Moved `get_hallucination_scenes` and `make_def_models` and `run_a_vehicle` into there\n",
    "    - Roadway recreation for enabling connection at merge point to make vehicle aware of lane\n",
    "        - Decided that start to end points ordering in txt file should be in direction of travel\n",
    "        - Separated main lane into until merge point, and after merge point\n",
    "        - Format of file is now 2 colums with x in col 1 and y in col2. Written using\n",
    "        `writedlm(\"filename\",coods,',')`\n",
    "        - 0 has become a, 1 has split into b and then c (direction of travel so b comes first)\n",
    "        - 2 has become d, 3 has become e"
